# Airbnb-Market-Behavior-Analysis || Power BI Dashboard



## Project Overview
This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset. It aims to uncover insights about Airbnb listings in New York City, including preferences in room types, neighborhood popularity, pricing trends, and host behaviors.

## Dataset
The analysis uses the "Airbnb NYC 2019.csv" file, which contains information about Airbnb listings in New York City. The dataset includes approximately 49,000 observations with 16 columns, mixing categorical and numeric data.

## Libraries Used
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Visualization Tools
- Power BI

## Key Analysis Points
1. Room type preferences
2. Neighborhood group popularity
3. Price distribution across room types
4. Relationship between price and number of reviews
5. Distribution of listings across neighborhood groups
6. Top hosts by number of listings

## Main Insights
- Entire homes/apartments are the most preferred room type, followed by private rooms.
- Brooklyn is more preferred than Manhattan, despite Manhattan having more listings.
- There's an inverse relationship between price and number of reviews.
- Manhattan has the highest number of listings, but not the highest number of reviews.
- Shared rooms are the least preferred room type.
- Price significantly influences customer preference, with lower-priced listings generally being more popular.

## Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations such as:
- Count plots
- Box plots
- Scatter plots
- Pie charts
- Bar plots

These visualizations help in understanding the distribution and relationships between different variables in the dataset.

## How to Run
#### EDA 
1. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries (numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib).
2. Download the "Airbnb NYC 2019.csv" file and place it in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the Python script to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.

#### Power BI Dashboard:
1. Install Power BI Desktop (if not already installed).
2. Open the .pbix file included in the project.
3. Refresh the data source if needed.
4. Interact with the dashboard to explore the data.

## Future Work
- Incorporate more recent data to track changes over time.
- Perform sentiment analysis on review data.
- Develop predictive models for pricing or popularity.
